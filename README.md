* Managed to do some actual device testing (Thanks Ted)
* Incorporated a boolean for emulator testing (w/o bluetooth support)
* Lock screen now lets the user move to the lock list page - both are hardcoded to some extent

* Working on getting the basics of bluetooth up and running
* Will be learning how UI works soon to incorporate Bluetooth
* Removed the tutorial project
* Added some open source bluetooth code which will be edited to fit our project
* Included models of the locks in code - not sure how these will work yet
